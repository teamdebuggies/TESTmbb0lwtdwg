      ## Rationale
      # Architecture Rationale
The proposed architecture focuses on transitioning from a monolithic architecture to a cloud-native microservices architecture, leveraging AWS services. Key components of the architecture include:

## Chosen Cloud-Native Patterns and Components
- **Microservices Architecture**: To address scalability and maintenance issues, the application is decomposed into smaller, manageable services.
- **API Gateway**: Facilitates communication between microservices and external clients, enabling easier integration with new technologies.
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless computing, allowing for event-driven architecture.
- **Amazon RDS**: For managed database services, ensuring reliability and scalability.
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: For distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances, improving performance during peak times.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Leverage AWS CloudWatch for real-time observability and alerting.

## Technology Decisions and Justification
- Using AWS allows for seamless scaling, reduced operational burden, and a robust security framework.
- The move to microservices enables independent development and deployment cycles, reducing time to market for new features.
- Implementing CI/CD practices through GitHub Actions ensures continuous integration and delivery, fostering rapid iteration and deployment.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: The microservices architecture allows for individual services to scale according to demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model of AWS reduces upfront costs.
- **Security**: Enhanced IAM policies and security groups will ensure the principle of least privilege.
- **Resilience**: The architecture is designed for high availability with load balancing and autoscaling capabilities.

This architecture aligns with industry standards in finance, ensuring compliance with evolving regulations while providing a more responsive service to customers.

      ## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
      # Architectural Decision Record

## Problem(s) to Solve
The legacy application faces scalability issues, high operational risk, slow feature delivery, and maintenance challenges due to the aging COBOL codebase.

## Analysis Performed
An in-depth analysis of the monolithic architecture revealed bottlenecks during peak hours, lack of observability, and difficulty in integrating with modern technologies.

## Decision and Justification
To modernize the system, a shift to a microservices architecture deployed on AWS was chosen. This approach addresses scalability, operational risk, and allows for quicker feature delivery while ensuring compliance with financial regulations.
